## **Step 1: Understanding How React Works Internally**  
Before diving into Fiber, let’s understand how React **renders, updates, and reconciles** components.  

- **How JSX Works**  
  - JSX is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()`, which returns a **React Element (virtual DOM node)**.  
  - Example:  
    ```jsx
    const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
    console.log(element);
    ```
    This compiles to:  
    ```js
    const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World!");
    ```
    The result is a **plain JS object** describing the UI.  

- **React Components and Render Flow**  
  - React **creates a tree of elements**, converts it to a **Fiber tree**, and then commits updates to the **real DOM**.  

- **Reconciliation (React Fiber Basics)**  
  - Fiber **breaks work into units** and schedules them efficiently.  
  - React uses a **work loop** (`requestIdleCallback` or `MessageChannel`) to process updates in chunks.

## **Step 2: Creating a React Project and Analyzing the Build**  
You should create a **barebones React app with Vite** and analyze the output.  

1. **Initialize a Vite project**  
   ```sh
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
   cd my-react-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Analyze the build process**  
   - Check `index.html` → React **attaches itself to a root div**.  
   - Inspect `main.jsx` → React renders using `createRoot()`.  

---

## **Step 3: Deep Dive into the React Rendering Engine (Fiber)**  
To understand how React works under the hood, you should:  

- Study **React Fiber Architecture**  
  - Fiber **uses a linked list structure**, unlike the old stack-based reconciliation.  
  - `beginWork()`, `completeWork()`, and `commitWork()` are key Fiber functions.  
  - Look at `ReactDOM.createRoot()`, which schedules the first render.  

- **Read React’s Source Code**  
  - Clone React:  
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/facebook/react.git
    cd react
    ```
  - Open `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.new.js` → This is where React handles rendering.  

---

## **Step 4: Virtual DOM and Diffing Algorithm**  
- The Virtual DOM is a **lightweight copy of the real DOM**.  
- React **compares (diffs) the old and new Virtual DOM** and updates only the changed parts.  
- Study **React’s diffing algorithm** (reconciliation) in:  
  - `ReactChildFiber.js` (for reconciling child components)  
  - `ReactFiberDiff.js` (core diffing logic)  

---

## **Step 5: React Scheduling and Concurrent Mode**  
- **React Fiber schedules rendering in chunks (priority-based updates).**  
- React batches state updates **asynchronously**.  
- Learn about:  
  - `requestIdleCallback`, `MessageChannel`, and how React decides when to render.  
  - **Concurrent Mode**: Allows React to work on rendering **without blocking the main thread**.  

---

## **Step 6: Understanding Hooks and React’s Execution Context**  
- Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` **store state in a linked list structure inside Fiber.**  
- **Study `ReactFiberHooks.js`** to see how React manages hook states.  
- Key functions:  
  - `renderWithHooks()` → Runs hooks in function components.  
  - `updateWorkInProgressHook()` → Tracks hook state changes.  

---

## **Step 7: React and the Browser (DOM updates, event handling)**  
- React **uses the event delegation pattern** and attaches event listeners to the `document`.  
- The `SyntheticEvent` system **normalizes events** across browsers.  
- Study event handling in **`ReactDOMEventListener.js`**.  

---

## **Step 8: Custom Renderer (Optional, Advanced)**  
- React can **render to non-DOM targets** (React Native, Ink for CLI, etc.).  
- Learn about `react-reconciler` package → You can create your own React renderer.
