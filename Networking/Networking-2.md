# **📌 How DNS Resolution Works (Step-by-Step)**  

When you type `https://google.com` in your browser, **your system needs to convert "google.com" into an IP address** before sending a request. This process is called **DNS resolution**, and it happens in multiple stages.

---

## **🔷 Step 1: Browser Cache Lookup (Fastest Check)**
Before making a network request, the browser **checks if it already knows Google's IP address** from a previous visit.  
✔ If found, the request proceeds immediately.  
❌ If not found, the system moves to the next step.  

---

## **🔷 Step 2: OS Cache Lookup (System Resolver)**
If the browser doesn't have the DNS record, it asks the **Operating System (OS)** to check its **local DNS cache** (stored in `/etc/hosts` in Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` in Windows).  
✔ If found, the system uses it.  
❌ If not found, the OS queries a **DNS server**.  

---

## **🔷 Step 3: Querying the Local DNS Server (Usually Your Router or ISP)**
If the OS cache does not have the IP, the system **sends a request to the configured DNS server** (usually set by your ISP or a public DNS like **Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`) or Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1`)**).  

- The **DNS query is sent over UDP port 53**.
- If the DNS server already has the IP in its cache, it **returns the result** immediately.
- If not, it performs a recursive lookup.  

---

## **🔷 Step 4: Recursive DNS Lookup (When ISP’s DNS Doesn’t Have the IP)**
If your ISP’s DNS server does not know the IP address, it performs a **recursive DNS lookup**, which involves contacting several DNS servers in this order:  

### **(1) Root DNS Servers (`.`)**
- The ISP’s DNS server contacts **one of the 13 global root servers**.
- The root server does not know Google's IP but **tells the ISP’s DNS server where to find the `.com` domain’s DNS servers**.  

### **(2) Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS Servers (`.com`)**
- The **TLD DNS server** (responsible for `.com` domains) is queried.
- It responds with the **address of Google’s authoritative DNS server**.  

### **(3) Google’s Authoritative DNS Server**
- The ISP’s DNS server contacts **Google’s DNS server**.
- Google’s DNS responds with **Google’s IP address (`142.250.183.14`)**.  

---

## **🔷 Step 5: Returning the DNS Response**
✔ The **ISP’s DNS server caches Google's IP** to respond faster next time.  
✔ The **ISP’s DNS server sends the IP back to your laptop**.  
✔ The **OS stores it in cache** for future use.  
✔ The **browser receives the IP and continues sending the HTTP request**.

## **🔷 Summary of the DNS Resolution Flow**
1️⃣ **Browser cache** → (If IP is found, use it)  
2️⃣ **OS cache** → (If IP is found, use it)  
3️⃣ **Local DNS Server (Router/ISP)** → (If cached, return IP)  
4️⃣ **Recursive DNS Lookup (If not cached)**  
   - 🌍 **Root DNS Server** → Finds `.com` TLD  
   - 🌎 **TLD DNS Server** → Finds Google’s DNS  
   - 🔥 **Google’s Authoritative DNS Server** → Returns the IP  
5️⃣ **Response is sent back to your laptop**  
6️⃣ **Browser uses the IP to make an HTTPS request**  

This entire process takes **milliseconds** but is critical for web browsing! 🚀🚀
